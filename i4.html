    <h2>Gohale</h2>
    <p>Cigarette smoking and alcohol use disorders are closely linked, but it is not clear whether higher rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) among smokers are solely attributable to heavier drinking, or alternatively, whether smokers are more vulnerable to alcohol abuse and dependence than non-smokers who drink comparable quantities. We sought to address this issue using data from a nationally representative U.S. sample of adolescents and young adults. Specifically, we analyzed the relationship between cigarette smoking, drinking, and alcohol use disorders.</p>
    <p>Gohale is a spell used against people who smoke and drink due to habitual. When we spell ' gohale', he/she stops smoking and drinking unnecessary and thinks of helping people who are in need</p>
