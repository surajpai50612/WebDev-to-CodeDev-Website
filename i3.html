    <p>What Is Poverty?
        Poverty is a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living. Poverty means that the income level from employment is so low that basic human needs can't be met. Poverty-stricken people and families might go without proper housing, clean water, healthy food, and medical attention. Each nation may have its own threshold that determines how many of its people are living in poverty.</p>
    <p>Goabundance is a spell used on poor people. When we spell ' goabundance', people who are poverty will be wealthy and even can find happiness in their life in what they do.</p>
