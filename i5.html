    <h2>Godcradle</h2>
    <p>There have always been homeless people in the United States. As economic circumstances and demographic forces have fluctuated, so have the size and composition of the homeless population, although relatively permanent skid rows where homeless people congregate have long been a feature of many large cities.</p>
    <p>Godcradle is a spell used against people who are homeless. When we spell 'godcradle' , person who is homeless will be provided with shelter and happiness.</p></body>
